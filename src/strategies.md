## How to catch a wolf in Alaska

How do you catch a single wolf in Alaska? 
You build a fence, and listen and divide Alaska in two.
You listen on which side you hear the howling, and split up that half.
If you continue this long enough, you will catch the wolf.


Strategies taken from Johson 1995 "Understanding troubleshooting styles to improbe training methods"

Troubleshooters use various strategies to identify faults dependent upon factors
such as;
* troubleshooter's level of expertise,
* type of system
* difficulty of the problem.

Johnson(1991) identified five common search strategies:
* trial and error
* exhaustive
* topographic
* half/split
* functional.

### Trial nd error
Trial and error is commonly used by novices. It is a random search rarely used by experts.
Lesgold et al. (1986) provided another version of this strategy called "swaptronics"
in which parts or subsystems known to be good, are inserted until one identifies
the correct area or component.

### Exhaustive
Exhaustive searches require little expertise, but are efficient only insituations where the component set is small.

### Topographic
Topographic searches are directed by tracing a schematic through the system identifying
a series of good/bad checks (Rasmussen & Jensen, 1974).
Two typesof topographic search strategies have been observed in troubleshooting activity based on the startingpoint of the search.
The first is starting at a known good point and working toward the fault (forward topographic), and the second is starting from the faulty condition (i.
., non-working lamp), andworking toward the input (reverse topographic) (Johnson et al. 1992).

### Half/split, binary, wolf fencing
The half/split, or binary searchmethod is an efficient means of reducing a problem space by checking for a proper condition at themiddle of the identified problem space.
If a proper condition exists a new reference point is selected in the middle of the remaining problem space.
The process is repeated until a single component remains.

### Functional
The functional method is the most difficult. Information about the system and its
components forms the basis of hypothesis selection (Johnson, 1991).
Various types of functional search exist as well. Basing a hypothesis on known 
system behavior and expected outcomes is the basic type of functional search.
Problem solvers can also construct a "runnable" mental model of the system in which the fault conditions are simulated (deKleer & Brown, 1981)
